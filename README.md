This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

This website features a sophisticated landing page built using a combination of React, Tailwind CSS, and an authorized REST API. The landing page is designed to display Capsules, with a modern banner layout, user-friendly search form, and elegant data grid. The website's responsive design and optimized search query ensure a quick and seamless user experience across different screen sizes and resolutions.

Tailwind CSS, a highly popular and efficient CSS framework, was used to create the website's clean and minimalist design. Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach and pre-built CSS classes allowed the me to build a highly functional and responsive user interface quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the framework's flexibility and customizability ensured a consistent and cohesive design language throughout the website.

The website's use of React and an authorized REST API facilitated the fetching and sending of data between SpaceX and the application. The search form, with three search filters for Capsules by status, original_launch, and type, was fully functional without bugs, and delivered quick results with an optimized search query. The data grid displayed the right amount of data, and pagination allowed for ten items per page, with a popup display of item data when clicked.

Overall, the website's use of Tailwind CSS in conjunction with React and an authorized REST API, Semantic HTML, and SEO best practices demonstrate a high level of proficiency and expertise in modern web development techniques. The result is a highly functional and visually appealing landing page that delivers an excellent user experience.
